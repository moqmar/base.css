# base.css
Simple but beautiful styling for all basic HTML elements in ~5KB. Useful as a basic stylesheet to build upon.

Provided classes:
- `inline`          - Only applies to IMG elements. Don't stretch images to the full width (default behaviour) but keep them inline instead.
- `float-<l|r>`     - Float an element to the left or right.
- `limit`           - Only take up up to 30% of the parent width. Useful for floating images.
- `clearfix[-l|-r]` - Clear the float alignment.
- `align-<l|c|r|j>` - Set text alignment to left/center/right/justify
- `table`           - Every table should be wrapped by a div with this class to make the table responsive.
- `button`          - Make an element (e.g. a link) look like a button.

Default fonts:
- Text and Forms: [Jaldi](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jaldi)
- Headlines: [Share](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Share)
- Code Blocks: [Fira Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono)
